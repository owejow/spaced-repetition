# FSRS Algorithm Overview

FSRS is a modern space repetition algorithm developed by Jarret Ye that improves
up on Anki's legacy SM-2 algorithm. SM-2 is a software package developed by
SuperMemo World and SuperMemo R&D with Piotr WoÅºniak. SM-2 is the first computer-based
SuperMemo algorithm.

The scheduler uses three variables to describe the status of a unitary memory
in the human brain:

1. **Retrievability**: The probability that a person can can recall a piece of
   information at any given point in time. Retrievability depends on elapsed
   time and statbility.
2. **Stability**: number of days required for Retrievability to decrease from
   100% to 90%. A stability of seven means that it takes one week for the
   probability of recalling a particular card drops to 90%
3. **Difficulty**: represents the inherent complexity of a given piece of
   information. This number represents how difficult is it to improve memory
   after a review.

## Algorthm description

These description are based of the [elixir implementation](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ex_fsrs/blob/master/lib/fsrs.ex) of the FSRS
algorithm. This version implements the card scheduler algorithm that determines
how often a card is retrieved.

The implementation contains 6 modules:

1. [[#Parameters]] : struct containing values for request retention,
   maximum interval, and weights.
2. [[#Card]] : struct containing values for due, stability, difficulty,
   elapsed_days, scheduled_days, reps, lapses, state, and last_review.
3. [[#ReviewLog]] : struct containing values for rating, elapsed days,
   scheduled_days, review, and state.
4. [[#Scheduling Info]] : struct containing values for card and reviewlog.
5. [[#Scheduling Cards]] : struct containing values for again, hard, good,
   and easy. It also contains the following important methods:
   updatestate, state, and record log.
6. [[#FSRS]] : implements the FSRS algorithm

The algorithm is described in greater detail
[here](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm).

### Parameters

The code for defining the Parameters struct is provided below. The _request_retention_ parameter
determines what

defmodule Parameters do
    defstruct request_retention: 0.9,
        maximum_interval: 36_500,
        weights:
